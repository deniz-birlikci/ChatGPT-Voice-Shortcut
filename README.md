## Usage

Just press on the "Elite Siri" widget. This will start a new conversation, where you can speak your prompt, and ChatGPT's answer will both be represented as text and also spoken back. 

The widget supports continuous conversations, so after it finishes reading ChatGPT's response, it will wait for another user input. 

To stop the application, just say "Stop".
